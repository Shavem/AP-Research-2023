# AP Research 2023
This repository currently contains my final AP Research paper submission for the 2022/2023 school year. This submission was granted a 5 by College Board and I hope it may inspire you to pursue your own technical "create" style project. If you have any questions or would like any advice, feel free to reach out.

Thanks for checking out my project!

## Additional Information
### Writing Process
I wrote and compiled my paper in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Overleaf is a free online LaTeX editor that allows you much more control over the output of your writing than your classic word processor (Microsoft Word or Google Docs). This style of writing can take a while to get used to and has a greater initial overhead and learning curve, but it will make writing any mathematical equations or formulas much easier for a technical style paper. I would suggest you give it a try early so that you will have time to learn it if you decide to use it to compile your final paper.

I have added my [Overleaf source files](Overleaf/) for your reference.
